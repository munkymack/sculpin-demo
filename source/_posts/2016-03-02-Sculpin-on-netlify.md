# Sculpin on netlify
This page is mainly created to demonstrate a basic Sculpin Blog site, with assets hosted on GitHub using netlify to deploy in continuous deployment.

Sculpin uses Markdown and twig and twig knows this page's name is: {{ page.title }}

We'll run some font and layout tests...

**This font is Bold.**

*This font is Italic.*

***This font is Bold and Italic.***

## Headline Title Two

### Headline Title Three

#### Headline Title Four
I wonder if the titles above will render in the proper size and font for headline 2, 3 and 4.
